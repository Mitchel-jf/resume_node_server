# Responsive Resume

This is the solution to the Stage 2 task for the HNG internship.       

I have next to zero knowledge of HTML and CSS, but I'm quite good with flutter.     

I created the resume with flutter using flutter web.        

I'm serving the resume with this Node.js server hosted on Heroku.       

The link to the repo of the flutter web app for this resume can be found below:

In the submission form, I couldn't find space to submit No. 2 assignment, a program that prints your name, so here's the link to the repo below (check the index.js):
